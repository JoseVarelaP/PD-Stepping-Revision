CurrentStageLocation=Select a stage that will be set as the theme's background.\n\n(Locations with (+P) indicate that they might cause perfomance issues.)

DediMeasureCamera=Select how many measures should the camera wait for the next angle.\n\n(Measures are divided into 4 beats, so keep that in mind when selecting.)
